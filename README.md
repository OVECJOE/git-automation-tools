# git-automation-tools
__A repo of small git tasks automation scripts.__

- **com-push** - a script that adds, commit and push untracked files and directories to existing remote repo.
> To add this script to path so it can be accessible anywhere, I will suggest you create a `bin/` directory in your home directory using `mkdir ~/bin`. Move the script to the directory using `mv com-push ~/bin/`. Then add the directory to path by adding `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin` to `.bash_profile` file. It will enable any of your scripts situated in  your `bin/` to be run from anywhere in the shell.
